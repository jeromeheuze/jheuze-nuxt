The game loop is a very important interaction while making a game. It is an event the player has to do during gameplay that will result in a feedback or absence of one.

A typical game is loop is as follows:

1. **Mental Model** - like what the player knows - gravity and walls are understood
2. **Action** - player is deciding to interact in more than one way
3. **Rules** - actions are being checked by the rules established
4. **Feedback** - the game will resolve actions + rules and show the result to the player
