Game Arcs are the link between actions and feedbacks to make something at the end more satisfactory to the players. Like matching 3 shapes to make them disappear and explode.

Let's look at it this way:

1. **Attention** - making an object shiny to attract players attention and make them curious about it.
2. **Relevance** - making the player curious is good, but it has to help them in some way - the players will see the need to interact or pursuit that shiny object to advanced. It becomes important as an incentive.
3. **Confidence** - make it possible and not impossible to achieve or the player will never do the task. Send feedbacks with voice cues or messages of encouragements.
4. **Satisfaction** - always reward the player when done.
