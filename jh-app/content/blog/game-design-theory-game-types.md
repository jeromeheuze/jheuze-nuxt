Let's look at the different types of games:
- **Analog** - like chess or checkerboards - something you play 1:1 in person
- **Digital** - games on phones, consoles, TV, computers, etc.
- **Gamification** - this is adding game mechanics to non-game - like using gamification on a website to add points / rewards / competition via leaderboard, etc.
- **Metaverses** - this should be added because I believe this new persistent media type that will cross between VR, WEBXR, AR, real location to total fictional world running in parallel where your actions will have consequences.  This is the analogy of Ready Player One type of entertainment where all our senses are being used.

But let's go deeper and look at some subtypes:
1. Sandbox
2. Real-time strategy (RTS)
3. Shooters (FPS and TPS)
4. Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA)
5. Role-playing (RPG, ARPG, and More)
6. Simulation and sports
7. Puzzlers and party games
8. Action-adventure
9. Survival and horror
10. Platformer
